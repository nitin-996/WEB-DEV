        <strong> HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web
        page and its content. For example,
        content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
        tables.<br>
        As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of <strong> HTML</strong> and its
        functions.
